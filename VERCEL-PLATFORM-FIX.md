# Vercel Platform Compatibility Fix

## Problem Identified

**Error**: `npm error EBADPLATFORM` for `@rollup/rollup-win32-x64-msvc@4.44.1`

**Root Cause**: 
- Windows-specific dependency `@rollup/rollup-win32-x64-msvc` was included in `devDependencies`
- Vercel builds run on Linux environment, causing platform incompatibility
- Error: `wanted {"os":"win32","cpu":"x64"} (current: {"os":"linux","cpu":"x64"})`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Windows-Specific Dependency
```json
// Removed from package.json devDependencies:
"@rollup/rollup-win32-x64-msvc": "^4.44.1"
```

### 2. Clean Reinstall
- Deleted `package-lock.json`
- Ran `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
- Successfully installed 474 packages without platform conflicts

### 3. Git Commit & Push
- Commit: `3086f7c` - "fix(platform): remove Windows-specific rollup dependency for Vercel compatibility"
- Pushed to GitHub to trigger new Vercel deployment

## Expected Result

âœ… **Vercel should now build successfully** because:
- No more Windows-specific dependencies
- Clean package-lock.json without platform conflicts
- All dependencies are cross-platform compatible

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Vercel Dashboard**: New deployment should start automatically
2. **Monitor Build Logs**: Should show successful `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
3. **Confirm Build Success**: No more EBADPLATFORM errors

## Timeline

- **Previous Commit**: `4a6f694` (had Windows dependency)
- **Fixed Commit**: `3086f7c` (removed Windows dependency)
- **Status**: Pushed to GitHub, awaiting Vercel auto-deployment

## Technical Notes

- Rollup bundler works fine without platform-specific optimizations
- The removed dependency was likely added automatically by a tool
- Future: Use `.npmrc` or package.json `optionalDependencies` for platform-specific packages

**Next**: Monitor Vercel deployment dashboard for successful build completion.
